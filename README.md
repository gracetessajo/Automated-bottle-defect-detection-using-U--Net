Automated bottle defect detection using  U -Net
DATASET :The bottle category in the MVTec AD dataset is specifically designed for industrial anomaly detection and is highly relevant for image processing projects focused on manufacturing and quality control.

The goal is to accurately identify and segment defects on bottle surfaces to aid quality control in manufacturing. The model leverages a U-Net encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections to combine both high-level contextual information and fine spatial details, enabling precise pixel-level segmentation of defects.

Performance
Accuracy: 97% on the test/validation set
Dice Coefficient: 0.91, indicating a high degree of overlap between predicted defect masks and ground truth annotations
